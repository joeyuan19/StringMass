This is an interactive demonstration for a problem in physics.  The problem exists as a number of masses connected by a string with a certain tension.  Environmental variables such as gravity, damping, driving force, mass, tension, and initial conditions are all customizable.

The buttons applet can be viewed through the included [html file](run.html) with the source code existing in the [bin](bin) folder.

All the features have keyboard shortcuts g for Gravity, d for Damping, f for driving Force, spacebar for pause/play, 1/2/3/4/5/6 for pre-set initial conditions, i for Interact (which allows you to move the individual masses wherever you choose).

Have fun!
